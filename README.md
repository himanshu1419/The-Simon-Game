Simon Game-
 This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The game challenges a player to recall and replicate an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds, testing memory and concentration.

How the Game Works:-
 The game generates a random sequence of four colors (Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow), each associated with a unique sound.
 The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
 As the player successfully follows the pattern, the sequence grows longer and the difficulty increases.
 If the player makes a mistake, the game resets, and they can start over.

Features
 Interactive UI with buttons that light up and play sounds.
Increasing difficulty with each level as the sequence becomes more complex.

Technologies Used-
 HTML5: For structuring the web page.
CSS3: For styling the game elements.
JavaScript: For game logic and dynamic interaction.
jQuery: For DOM manipulation and event handling.

How to Play:
  Press any key to start the game.
Watch the sequence of lights and sounds carefully.
Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
The sequence will get longer with each successful attempt.
If you press the wrong button, the game will play a "wrong" sound, and you can start over by pressing any key.
